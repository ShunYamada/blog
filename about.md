I am a millennial entrepreneur. Currently, I’m focusing on making the job only people can do. I founded Ciao Technologies, and developed [spacehacker](http://spacehacker.jp/). That’s an online platform that connects remote workers/freelancers with co-working space. And I broadcasted [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xLeGS0aP0Fnpw3TASEA1A) in San Francisco. Please chat me anytime :)
