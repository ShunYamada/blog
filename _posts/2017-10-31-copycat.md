I hate 2 things. One is to be satisfied the existing state of ownself. That often prevents the growth, you will not be able to reach your own goal. If you often see anyone who is only proud of the past glory and his acquaintance, you should break off with him right now. Be hungry. Another is to envy someone. Envy person just envies what someone has already and to dreams how much fun it is if his life is that someone’s life. To hear that talking about living other’s life, so annoy for me.

To respect is falsely semilar with to envy. I’m trying to respect people I always meet up. (I feel so for every person, that is too difficult). Authors of books teach me, Developers of services teach me. I all respect them. After I learn from them, I will try to improve my daily life. To tell the truth, my one friend has been writing the blog in English. So I have started this blog. I respect him and I just want to become one who likes him.

That’s a good thing to respect and imitate others and other services. Although to imitate someone is generally considered a bad thing, but that’s false.

> Good artists copy. Great artists steal. - Pablo Picasso

That’s true because Picasso said so, he is the king of the artists is said to be that imitation is taboo. I beieve imitation is general for making good things.

Well, my motto is “Genius is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent imitation.” This word is very imitation from Great Edison one. Making thing is almost container of imitation but needs one per cent inspiration. Inspiration is the one which experesses who you are. In startup world, there’re so many services like Uber for X and Airbnb for X. That’s a quite different whether each service is coming from seeing Uber or founder’s own problem. In my country, the former is majority. The startup will bring wealth for founders but that will never change the world.
