One of the problems a startup faces when they changes their idea is that there is nothing to solve. Usually, they start from a problem but the time it takes to change does not give them any problems to solve.

Some startups incliding mine tend to fall in this problem and I have asked every person who I meet what challenges you the most. So we called it Yamady Problem.

You should decide to choose the most important tasks from the several other lesser ones. If you are a technical CEO, you will always code faster than be able to think deeply about the problem without having to learn from scratch most of the time.

These are a list of certain problems you should avoid when beginning a startup company.

## Like Customer Interview

Customer interview is one of the most essential aspects when creating a startup. However, do you really interview to your user. I saw some startup friends ask their real friends, they're not even potential users. When you do that before developing, that's controversy because nobody uses your service yet. So that is never customer interview.

When you have no service, you must not get some opinions to your idea from others. Sell first before you produce something.

When Bill Gates heard that IBM was looking for an OS for the IBM PC he stepped in and claimed he could deliver the such a desired OS. The reality was that he had never written an OS, but he knew that a few blocks away someone had developed a Quick and Dirty Operating System(QDOS) for microcomputers. Gates bought QDOS for \$ 50,000 (the original developer knew nothing of the prospective deal with IBM), tinkered together the necessary changes in the software, went back to IBM with it, and made the bilion dollar deal.

This is not only the case of B2B. Airbnb starts their service by post a room information on Craig List. Whether you have already developed service or not, that doesn't matter. They will buy that when they realize that value.

## Survey

To collect majority answer is what the more unnecessary. Every startup idea is orgins from minority, you should never depend on majority's opinions.

The same is true about interview but you should stay a deaf for majority's voice always. Addition to this, what they say is often different from what they think really. Anyways to solve the problem already been manifested doesn't match with the way of startup. We have to reach out potential problem. Avoid noise, others told you, with the broaden eyes you watch the world, and you should focus on thinking deep about the problem when you find. Survey is never an entrepreneur's job.

## Find the Problem

That's simple to think deep the problem after finding. Just ask why you face the problem and whether the current way is real solution or not. After repeating to ask, you will reach the breakthrough idea. The more hard thing is to find out the problem.

Nobody has the answer if you asked. You can't try to find any problems becuase most problems are solved already. My answer is to spend your livings smart. Is that you ride a train every morning is the best way to arrive your office? Do you have no option without that? You can use a taxi with your colleague lives close to you, and you don't have to commute everyday when you have tasks to be completed done in front of your PC. Thinking smarter than usual is the fact you may reach out the real solution.

There're some troubles when everybody tries to live smart. Startups may distrubs these things.
