I clearly remember the moment when my life changed at all. About 3years ago, I have quit my job and I had no idea what to do next. Curiosity drove me to go and visit San Francisco. My biggest life event was to join Google I/O party. I have met so many people that were passionate and who had their own vision, so I have felt very motivated. I know why I have felt like this because we shared the same sense of purpose. We all have a product and mission, but we all have only one purpose. We just focus on making the world a better place.

We think that it's very important to make the world a better place for the next generations. We have several serious problems. For example, climate change, health in poor countries, promoting effective altruism … These problems involve all people around the world, and we can help with each for solving them. And you know, solving problems will have a new value in the world. That's the startup, maybe.

## Three things why I made this startup

There are so many jobs currently, actually I have researched it too. When I was a college student, I joined an internship with the congressman of Tokyo city, and I have contributed to some NPOs. Finally, I found the job as an entrepreneur, and I will continue this startup until I die. Here, I’d like to tell why I decided startup suits perfect for me.
I don't have enough skills and the mindset but I have the confidence to contribute to the world. There are the only three things that will be bring me to go step by step.

### Never give up

I have decided to never give up this startup. There have been days where I have encountered several failures, my co-founder quit, I was out of money and my pillows were wet from tears, but I never thought of quitting.Compared to what other startup founders traced, my problems were small. Whatever happens in the future, I’ll never give up startup.

### Never care

I have passed my days as "Stay hungry, Stay foolish" as Steve Jobs said. I have never cared about how embarrassingly I failed, or how sorry I did anything. However, I have never felt that way. I know, people often say "He is pathetic". But the same people have already forgotten what they have said or what did they eat for dinner.

### Resourceful

In San Francisco, I have lived a poverty life for a year. I’ve been thinking how to survive without cost. TI was thinking like a growth hacker. Information and connection with people became more important than anything, and I felt to become resourceful so on.

## My living in the future

What kind of future do you imagine?
That is the most important question for every entrepreneur. Here is a quote from [the essay of Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html).

> Paul Buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field "live in the future." Combine that with Pirsig and you get:
> Live in the future, then build what's missing.
> That describes the way many if not most of the biggest startups got started. Neither Apple nor Yahoo nor Google nor Facebook were even supposed to be companies at first. They grew out of things their founders built because there seemed a gap in the world.

The future of every entrepreneur is different. But you shouldn't think about what is missing, you should think about what you believe.

By the way, in my future, automatic technologies will replace what we work currently with tremendous speed. Many jobs are expected to replace machines. In the future, what should we do after we loose our jobs? Missing things for the future is the job that only people can do.

> Tom Friedman is an author and he says there's three types of jobs:
> Jobs with the hand, jobs with the head,
> and jobs with the heart.Technology first typically disrupts jobs with the hand.
> For example,100 years ago almost everyone was a farmer.
> Today there's not a lot of farmers. Machines have automated a lot of farming. Technology then, eventually disrupts jobs of the head.
> But what technology can never do, technology can never disrupt jobs with the heart.
> And hospitality is service with heart.Machines cannot create belonging. Only people can do that.Only a host can do that.
> So while robots are disrupting people all over the world, actually it turns out that you are disrupting robots in all the mass produced hospitality around the world that would otherwise permeate.

I agree with [this speech of Brian Chescky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bor-OyjULnM).

I believe that from now on, I must make the job that only people can do. Firmly believe that we must make such job that everyone can have a sense of purpose against the big change involving millions of people.
