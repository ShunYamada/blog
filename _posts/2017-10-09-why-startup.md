I clearly remind the moment when my life changed at all. About 3years ago, I quit job and no idea what I did next. Just curiosity drove me to visit to San Francisco. My big life event is to join Google I/O before party. I have met up with so many people have passion and own vision, I felt so motivated. I know why I felt so, we shared one sense of purpose. We have each product and mission, but the purpose is only one. We just focus on making the world better place.

What we can think like this is so important for our generation. We have several serious problems. For example, climate change, health in poor countries, promoting effective altruism … These problems involve all people around the world, and we can help with each for solving them. And you know, solving problems lead new value in the world. That’s startup, maybe.

## 3 things that’s why I have got startup

There’re so many jobs currently, actually I have researched ones also. When I was a college student, I joined internship with congressman of Tokyo city, contribute to some NPOs. Finally, I found the job as an entrepreneur, and I will continue to do startup until I die. Here, I’d like to tell why I decided startup suits perfect for me.
I am not enough skillset and mindset, but have a confidence to contribute current world. There’re my only three things that bring me to go step by step.

###  Never give-up
I have decided never give up this startup. There have been days, I have passed through several failures, co-fonuder quit, out of money and my pillows were wet with tears, but I never thought quit it. Compared to what other startup founders traced, my problems are only small. Whatever happens in the future, I’ll never give up startup.

### Never care
I have passed my days as “Stay hungry, Stay foolish” Steve Jobs said. I never care how embarrassing I fails, how sorry I do anything. Everyone told me that my FREERIDER project may have been a symbol of shame. However, I have never felt that way. I know, people often feel “He is pathetic.” for the moment, but next day they have already forgot for their thinking what they’ll eat for dinner.

### Resourceful
In SanFrancisco, I lived such a poverty life for a year. I’ve been thinking how to survive without cost. This thinking likes growth hacker. Information and connection with people became  more important than anything, and I felt to become resourceful so on.

## My living in the future
What kind of future do you imagine?
That is the most important question for every entrepreneur. Here is a quote from [the essay of Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html).

> Paul Buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field "live in the future." Combine that with Pirsig and you get:
Live in the future, then build what's missing.
That describes the way many if not most of the biggest startups got started. Neither Apple nor Yahoo nor Google nor Facebook were even supposed to be companies at first. They grew out of things their founders built because there seemed a gap in the world.

The futures each entrepreneurs imagine are different. But we should make missing things from the future you want, you believe.

By the way, in my future, automatic technologies will replace what we work currently with tremendous speed. Many jobs are expected to replace machines. In the future, what we should do after we lost jobs. Missing things for the future is job that only people can do.

> Tom Friedman is an author and he says there's three types of jobs:
Jobs with the hand, jobs with the head,
and jobs with the heart.Technology first typically disrupts jobs with the hand.
For example,100 years ago almost everyone was a farmer.
Today there's not a lot of farmers. Machines have automated a lot of farming. Technology then, eventually disrupts jobs of the head.
But what technology can never do, technology can never disrupt jobs with the heart.
And hospitality is service with heart.Machines cannot create belonging. Only people can do that.Only a host can do that.
So while robots are disrupting people all over the world, actually it turns out that you are disrupting robots in all the mass produced hospitality around the world that would otherwise permeate.

I agree [this speech of Brian Chescky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bor-OyjULnM).

I believe that from now on, I must make job that only people can do. Firmly believe that we must make such job that everyone can have a sense of purpose against the big change involving millions of people.
